QA_GEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
As a hypothetical Swisscom customer experiencing a specific issue, your task is to create a question that reflects the problem you are facing. The question should adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Contextual Relevance: Your question must be answerable using only the information provided in the context. Ensure that your question is directly related to the context given.
2. Specificity: Aim for a specific, problem-oriented question rather than a broad or general inquiry. For instance, instead of asking "Can I use Swisscom Low Power Network in other countries?", specify your situation by asking "I am planning a trip to France next week â€” will my Swisscom Low Power Network service work there?"
3. Complexity: Frame your question around a piece of non-trivial information from the context, avoiding overly simplistic or obvious questions. Rather than asking, "What is the Swisscom Low Power Network (LPN)?", ask a more application-focused question like "How can I connect my smart thermostat to the Internet?". Do not provide answer in the question: rather than asking "I unable to access my Mobile Combox messages, could this be due to recent maintenance work?", ask "Why am I unable to access my Mobile Combox messages?".
4. Personal Perspective: Do not disclose that the context was provided to you. Write the question as if you are personally experiencing the issue.
5. Issue Description (if applicable): Briefly describe the issue you're facing to provide context for your question. Instead of asking, "What is the data usage limit for prepaid and postpaid users?", present your problem by asking, "I've noticed I can't use my data anymore. What's the limit for prepaid customers?"

After crafting your question, also provide a succinct answer that is directly supported by the context provided. The answer should be clear, concise, and based on the information available."""

QA_GEN_SYSTEM_COMMUNITY_PROMPT = "The given context is from a community forum and may include inappropriate or inaccurate content. In the question and answer you are generating, do not mention any user specific information, but only use the knowledge extracted.

Please provide a single valid JSON object containing two fields: a `question` field with your formulated question, and an `answer` field with a short and helpful answer to the question, which must be supported by the context.
